Machine learning
ml is a study of algorithms ,which improves the performance
of machine without using explicit programme
it means ml learns from the previous experience
==>  we have 3 types of algorithms
1. supervised machine learning
        -machine is learning under the supervision of human
        -both input and out are provided to machine
        (evaluation of both original and predicted outcom)
2. unsupervised
        -machine learns itself without help of human/third party
        (our job is to predict the output)
        (to find accuracy of model we build))
       e.g: video games(ludo,chess....so on)
3. Reinforced
        -without environment such as automated cars
        e.g: image recognition,text to speech,traffic detection

** ALGORITHMS **
2 types:
   1.  regression algorithms :if data under target col is continues(float values)
        a.linear
        b.multi
        c.polynomial
        d.logistics
   2.  classification algorithms :if data under target col is discrete(yes/on)
        a.KNNeighbours
        b.k means clustering
        c.SVM
        d.Random Forest
        e.Decision tree
        f.principle component analysis
